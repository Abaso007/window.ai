# Window.ai Website

This example shows how to implement a simple chat bot using Next.js and Window.ai.

Run Next.js in development mode:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The app should be up and running at http://localhost:3000.

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=edge-middleware-eap) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).
